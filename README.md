This is repo is a compilation of all the assignments I had to complete in my grade 11 CS course in which I achieved a 97%

------------------------------------------

The "test11" and "test12", "stores" and "tablesofvalues", and "question 2" and "squaring" are tests in order. two programs per test. Everything else are assignments not in order - it sorted by first letter :(
